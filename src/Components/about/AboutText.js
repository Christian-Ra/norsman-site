      "Founded in 2003 by Brent Norsman, Norsman Architects is centered in Chicago with work extending to the greater Midwest. Established as an Architectural firm, our reach of service has extended to urban design and construction. As architects, we have developed a practice that merges sustainability and design through a focus on research and innovation. With demonstrated abilities as strong communicators and facilitators with the stakeholders on any given project, we believe in a balanced and nuanced approach to each project.",
      "With a wide array of project scales and typologies, there is no project or approach to construction which gives us cause for hesitation. As practitioners well versed in experimentation and implementation, we look forward to each new challenge with a fresh perspective.",
      "Our work and skill set has been honed to avidly investigate and experiment with sustainable design and development, believing that a sustainable practice can meet the demands of any project and is simply responsible design. Sustainability, self-sustaining practice rooted in community, focuses attention on the livability of the street in addition to the built environment. The promotion of this concept is integral to everything we do, from the design of a building to our interaction and involvement in the community, to our place in the larger context of the regions in which we practice. We work hard to stitch our buildings and their occupants into the urban fabric.",
      "In 2006, Mr. Norsman established House Plant, Inc., the design-build construction arm of the firm. This has not only enhanced the firm’s understanding of the construction process and provided value to our clients, it has also enriched our understanding of the construction process. This “hands-on” experience has brought greater understanding of budget and schedule and provided greater control in the execution of our designs.",
      "By thoughtfully and sensitively fostering relationships between architecture, its occupants and the urban and natural environments, Norsman Architects creates structures and sites that are as unique as their circumstances.",

      "Norsman Architects seek innovative solutions for built environments. As a full service architectural practice, our projects present opportunities to explore new paradigms in housing and urban development; including mixed-use developments, environmentally responsive adaptive reuse, commercial and residential work.",
      "With an emphasis on conceptual exploration, Norsman Architects believe that a building’s use, its context and original characteristics are critical tools that guide the design process. We work to enrich and enliven this process through a thoughtful and collaborative approach with all parties to the construction process, continually seeking the highest standards of design excellence.",
