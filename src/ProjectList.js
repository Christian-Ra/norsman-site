      "Reinforcing the owner’s belief that the street is a vital component of our urban community, elements of the street are brought into the cafe.  As you enter, a seven foot tall photo light-box of the neighborhood’s famous six-corner intersection greets guests.  Above the chrome and dark wood of the coffee bar, the baristas’ work is illuminated by retrofitted Chicago streetlights while a wide storefront displays to the street the intimate 1,000 square foot interior space and backlit coffee bar.  The polished concrete floors underfoot physically and visually connect with the city sidewalks.",
      "Marbled bamboo plywood also gives the space a sense of warmth reminiscent of the shop’s inspiration.  The plywood material is carried throughout the space, on the custom communal tables, chairs, wall paneling and the CNC-sculpted ceiling.  The layered ceiling is inspired by the baristas artistic pouring of steamed milk into coffee. The seating plan maximizes occupancy and circulation.  The traditional walk up espresso counter further encourages interaction and reaffirms the cafe’s symbiotic relationship with its community",

The first level is existing and has gothic-inspired windows, exaggerated moldings and is used primarily for formal entertaining and living.  Finish materials, including black slate, ebony floors and dark grey painted walls, create a formal but muted backdrop to the owner's modern furniture and architectural rendering collections.",
      "The second level addition is reached via a custom two-piece spiral staircase. As the steps progress, the staircase inverts itself, creating a literal transition from the exterior to the interior of the staircase, suggesting the more private nature of the second level. Here, the historic materials of the first floor give way to light-colored materials, including white resin, teak floors and fiber cement wall panels. Interior sliding glass dividers enable the space to transform from two bedrooms to an open, airy loft in addition to a 12' x 35' skylight and north facing wall of glass that leads to the roof deck and stationary lap pool.",
