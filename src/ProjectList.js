      "The adaptive re-use and addition to this existing historical, Georgian-style residence presented a challenge.  How to resolve the 120-year-old historic exterior with a modern interior. At the core of the home is a two-story space that was carved from the building by removing the 2nd floor ballroom. This central, family gathering area includes a hearth, formal living and dining room spaces.  The arch top front façade windows in the space were enhanced by removing the bricked-in half circle tops.  An open central metal and millwork custom stair connects the floors and centers the plan in this two-story space.  A terraced sunroom addition was added to the rear of the home that steps down from the first floor of living to the generous rear yard of this triple-lot home. Large format lift-and-slide windows, skylights and a green roof above stitch the rooms interior to the exterior.  Minimally detailed, white-washed white oak wall paneling and millwork line the first floor.  The building’s exterior was lovingly restored with all new copper sheet metal work, a new slate roof and restored masonry that cement the owner’s desire to make an investment in the historic home that will last another 120 years.",

      "This adaptive re-use and addition to a historic limestone façade structure on Wicker Park’s bustling Division Street boulevard sought to create a contextually scaled and relevant in-fill façade to the existing street wall.  Window openings and floors were scaled to the existing surrounding context, and a sun-shading louvered façade was added to the addition.  The finely detailed louvers on each floor are installed at different angles so the façade can dynamically reveal itself slowly as one approaches and reveals the fiber-cement green colored rainscreen behind, activating the facade.",

      "This extensive renovation and addition to an existing 120 + year old Victorian era frame home was a near re-construction of the original structure.  The project was driven by the owner’s desire to “re-use” the home they had renovated 25 years prior and have lived in since.  Side additions were added to the wide lot home to create a focal point landscaped courtyard centered on the new custom steel and glass stair and custom millwork throughout.  An attached garage with rooftop garden and Ipe sustainable decking and trellis makes for meaningful outdoor urban space.  Every effort was made to emphasize the connection between interior and exterior landscaped areas including a third-floor sunroom that provides a wintertime sun-filled retreat.",

The challenge presented by this addition was to respect this sacred, historic space while discreetly adding a new substantial bar and restaurant addition.  The existing packaged goods store and bar were left virtually untouched with only one new access point to the addition at the rear of the bar in typical speak-easy fashion.  Guests must bathe in the history of the original bar prior to entering the new addition. The entire one-story roof of the addition is warped and rises to the street creating a dynamic street presence.  A skylight above the bar warps and twists to meet the northern sun providing indirect daylighting over the mixologist area.  Simple, inexpensive materials are used in a creative fashion throughout.  The roof tile mosaic is cut from standard plywood.  The sheets are cut in a precise fashion and reassembled in a colorful mosaic. Shou sugi ban burnt wood slats are assembled on the bar front in another mosaic custom pattern. Inexpensive pine boards are stained, cut and assembled on the front façade. Skatelite, a material used for the surfaces of skate parks, is used for table tops and the bar top.  All bar/restaurant furniture was custom designed and fabricated on site of stained birch plywood.",

Neither floor had the ceiling height to accommodate the new brewing equipment.  By removing a portion of the first-floor loft construction, we were able to locate the brewery in the basement and utilize the existing freight elevator to move products in and out of the facility.  A glass atrium surrounds the new two-story space so the brewing production could be observed from the tasting room/ Brewpub on the first floor.  Material from the removed floor was re-purposed to create bar tables and booths in the tasting room.  Art walls adorn the walls of the Brewpub from artists curated by the owner who happens to own a “counter-culture” contemporary art gallery in this “Back of the Yards” neighborhood.",
